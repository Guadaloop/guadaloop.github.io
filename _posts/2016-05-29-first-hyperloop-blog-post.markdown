Welcome to our new blog, Guadaloopers! We'll be posting photo updates and weekly progress reports on this page for all of you to follow along on our road to the competition in August. This week features photos of the newly welded base of our frame, as well as our Design Lead Patryk Radyjowski levitating on our air bearings! We've also included photos of our new lab space so that you can begin to get acquainted. It ain't much, but it feels like home (just don't remind us how much time we're going to spend in there this summer). Next steps are connecting our air bearings to the base of our frame, and building our first braking module.

Please follow along, share with friends, and if you feel so inclined, donate to support our quest for a faster future at gofundme.com/texasguadaloop. We still need to raise $10,000 to complete our pod and transport it out to California. Thanks for reading!
